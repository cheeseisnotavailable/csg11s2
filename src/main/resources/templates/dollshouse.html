<p><i>i[SCENE.—A room furnished comfortably and tastefully, but not extravagantly. At the back, a door to the right leads to the entrance-hall, another to the left leads to Helmer’s study. Between the doors stands a piano. In the middle of the left-hand wall is a door, and beyond it a window. Near the window are a round table, arm-chairs and a small sofa. In the right-hand wall, at the farther end, another door; and on the same side, nearer the footlights, a stove, two easy chairs and a rocking-chair; between the stove and the door, a small table. Engravings on the walls; a cabinet with china and other small objects; a small book-case with well-bound books. The floors are carpeted, and a fire burns in the stove. It is winter.</i>

A bell rings in the hall; shortly afterwards the door is heard to open. Enter NORA, humming a tune and in high spirits. She is in outdoor dress and carries a number of parcels; these she lays on the table to the right. She leaves the outer door open after her, and through it is seen a PORTER who is carrying a Christmas Tree and a basket, which he gives to the MAID who has opened the door.]

NORA.
Hide the Christmas Tree carefully, Helen. Be sure the children do not see it until this evening, when it is dressed. <i>i[To the PORTER, taking out her purse.]</i> How much?

PORTER.
Sixpence.

NORA.
There is a shilling. No, keep the change. <i>i[The PORTER thanks her, and goes out. NORA shuts the door. She is laughing to herself, as she takes off her hat and coat. She takes a packet of macaroons from her pocket and eats one or two; then goes cautiously to her husband’s door and listens.]</i> Yes, he is in. <i>i[Still humming, she goes to the table on the right.]</i>

HELMER.
<i>i[calls out from his room]</i>. Is that my little lark twittering out there?

NORA.
<i>i[busy opening some of the parcels]</i>. Yes, it is!

HELMER.
Is it my little squirrel bustling about?

NORA.
Yes!

HELMER.
When did my squirrel come home?

NORA.
Just now. <i>i[Puts the bag of macaroons into her pocket and wipes her mouth.]</i> Come in here, Torvald, and see what I have bought.
